# mkvnmp4

Script to remove the duplicated .mkv files from my media server.

# How to Install

First, you'll need a config file in one of three locations:

#. `/etc/mkvnmp4.conf`
#. `~/.mkvnmp4.conf`
#. `~/.config/mkvnmp4.conf`

It needs to contain the directory locations of where you want the program to search.

Then, run `mkvnmp4` from the git directory and it'll auto-link to `/usr/local/bin`
